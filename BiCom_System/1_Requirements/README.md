# BIDIRECTIONAL COMMUNICATION REMOTE KEYLESS ENTRY SYSTEM (BiCom System)

## Description
 
The Bicom system involves the design of the remotely locking or unlocking access to automobiles and it requires two components transmitter and reciever. It can be implemented    with using the encryption method and operates by broadcasting radio waves on a particular frequency bidirectionally. It is also able to display the status of the car such as window, alarm, car battery information, light approach.

## State of Art

* By using this advanced modern technologies we can remotely monitoring the status of the car
* The transmissions between the car and key are encrypted to prevent theft
  
## Identifying features
  
  * Display Window status for one user button click
  * Display Alarm status for two user button clicks
  * Display car battery info for three user button clicks
  * Display Door status for four user button clicks

## Advantages

* Convenience, better security, automatic work control
* No need of human interaction with the car
* This system provides easy security access to the automobiles through encryption
* The automobile owners shall get benefited

## Disadvantages

* If remote is lost then automobile security is in more trouble
* If any other remote have our remote frequency then our automobile security is in trouble
* This system works on certain limited range
