# REMOTE KEYLESS ENTRY SYSTEM (RKE SYSTEM)

 ## Description
 
The RKE system involves the design of the remotely locking or unlocking access to automobiles such as cars, jeep etc., An Automobile is a land vehicle used to carry passengers. Automobiles usually have four wheels and an engine or motor to make them move. Remote keyless entry (RKE) system is a system designed to remotely lock or unlock access to automobiles. Security is more important in automobiles as they are costly to buy. Costly cars had more features than normal cars. In this project, we are going to lock or unlock the automobiles using remote.

## State Of Art

RKE transmission requires two components - a transmitter and a receiver
* Transmitter - RKE key fob, other ID device with RKE integrated
* Receiver - Body Control ECU, other ECU with integrated RKE RKE operates by broadcasting radio waves on a particular frequency unidirectionally. RKE systems implement encryption and rolling code algorithms to prevent car thieves from intercepting and spoofing the telegrams
 
## Identifying features
  
 * Door must be locked for one user button click
 * Door must be unlocked for two user button clicks
 * Activation and Deactivation of alarm for three user button clicks
 * Approach light for four user button clicks

## Advantages

* Easy to use
* It helps to protect automobile from thieves
* It is very easy to find automobiles if more cars are present

## Disadvantages

* If any other remote have our remote frequency then our automobile security is in trouble
* If our remote is lost then our automobile security is in more trouble
  
## SWOT Analysis
